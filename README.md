# cloud-file-storage-manager
Developed a Cloud File Storage Manager using Django REST Framework and React that allows users to upload, manage, and securely share files stored on AWS S3. Implemented JWT authentication, role-based access control, file search functionality, and secure sharing links to simulate a Google Drive-like cloud storage system.
